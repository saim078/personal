	<pre>
	<span class="proposal">Introduction</span>
	Robo Kiddos is a Learning Management System for kids, which provides web and
mobile platform for kids and their guardians.
	<span class="proposal">Objective</span>
	To provide platform for taking and enrolling courses specialized for kids for learning
skills and to provide a platform for guardians to get reported and notified by their kids
performance in different courses.
	<span class="proposal">Problem Description</span>
	What was the Problem? No proper platform for kids to learn skills and courses online to
make them grow for future, and more importantly no platform for their guardians where
they can get notified with overall performance of their kids.
	Why was the problem? Because nearly all platforms in the world are for adults for
learning, and there is no platform where kids can learn skills for their future growth and
their guardians gets reported with performance of their kids or are their kids taking online
classes or not, especially during era of COVID-19.
	How we are going to solve this problem? By providing kids with a web platform which
will be for kids where they can enroll to different courses and learn skills online, and
more importantly providing their guardians with a mobile platform where they can see
their kids report related to their performance, schedule and attendance, and get notified
with any new courses which would be fruitful for their kids based on their performances.
<span class="proposal">	Methodology</span>
	Creating Web based application which will be for kids where they can enroll to different
courses and learn skills online by streaming courses on our Web App, Web App will be
made using technologies REACTJS for front end web development and NODEJS,
EXPRESSJS for backend development of server for both mobile and web development.
	Creating Mobile application where their guardians can see their kids report related to
their performance, schedule and attendance, and get notified with any new courses which
would be fruitful for their kids based on their performances. Mobile application will be
made using KOTLIN and backend will be same as for Web application.
